# **RidesDataAnalysis-Exploration**

Hello everyoneðŸ‘‹, welcome to the Rides Data Analysis project. In this project, Python, Pandas, and Plotly were utilized to analyze the 'rides.csv' dataset, handle missing data, and ensure data quality.

## **ðŸš€ Overview**

This project focuses on three main aspects:

1. **Data Analysis:** Python, Pandas, and Plotly were employed to explore and analyze the 'rides.csv' dataset. The primary goal was to gain insights into the dataset, handle missing data, and ensure data quality.

2. **Demand-Supply Analysis:** A thorough examination of the relationship between active drivers per hour (Supply) and active riders per hour (Demand) was conducted using a Plotly scatter plot. Additionally, the elasticity of demand concerning active drivers was calculated.

3. **Supply Ratio:** The supply ratio, defined as rides completed per active driver per hour, was computed and visualized in a Plotly scatter plot.

## **âš¡ Key Findings**

- The data analysis provided valuable insights into the 'rides.csv' dataset, contributing to a better understanding of the overall trends and patterns.
  
- The Demand-Supply analysis shed light on the correlation between active drivers and riders per hour, providing essential information for optimizing service levels.

- The Supply Ratio analysis helped in assessing the efficiency of the system by examining the rides completed per active driver per hour.

## **ðŸ’» Tools Used**

- Python
- Pandas
- Plotly

## **ðŸ¤– How to Use**

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abhitechg/Demand-and-Supply-Analysis.git
   ```

2. Open and run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to reproduce the analysis.
   ```bash
   cd Demand-and-Supply-Analysis
   jupyter notebook analysis.ipynb
   ```
